Ruby on Rails (RoR) in AWS Elastic Beanstalk
============================================



Create a Ruby environment in AWS Elastic Beanstalk
--------------------------------------------------

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=us-east-1#/newEnvironment?applicationName=Elastic%20Beanstalk%20Ruby%20Sample%20App

Configure the _Create a web server environment_ page as follows:

* Platform
  * Preconfigured platform: Ruby
* Base configuration
  * Application code: Sample application

Click _Create environment_ â€“ AWS will begin creating a Ruby environment, including a basic credentials file.

Note the version of Ruby (e.g. 2.6).



Install Rails and create a project
----------------------------------

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/ruby-rails-tutorial.html


### Switch to the correct version of Ruby

An easy way to accomplish this is to install and use the Ruby Version Manager.

`$ rvm use 2.6.3`


### Install Rails

`$ gem install rails`


### Create a new Rails project

`$ rails new eb-rails`

This step is for documentation, as this repository is already comprised of a Rails project.
